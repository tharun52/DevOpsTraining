2. Problem Statement

Task #1: The Missing Message Mystery
Alice tries to send "HELLO WORLD" to Bob’s server. However, Bob only receives part of the message.
As the detective, your job is to investigate why the message is incomplete and fix the issue so Bob receives the full string

# server.py
message = client_socket.recv(11)

previously it was 8 but 'HELLO WORLD' has 11 characters
so i changed it to 11 and it works

output:
% python3 client.py
📤Alice sent: 'HELLO WORLD'

%  python3 server.py
🏠 Bob's server is listening...
📨 Bob received: 'HELLO WORLD'


Task #2: The Port Scanner Probe
🧩 Scenario
A detective always checks locked and unlocked doors. Similarly, you will create a simple port
scanner that tests whether a given port on a host is open or closed

# check_server.py
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

hostname = input("Enter hostname : ")
port = int(input("Enter port : "))
    
try:
    s.connect((hostname, port))
    print(f"Port {port} on {hostname} is Open")
    s.close()
except:
    print(f"Port {port} on {hostname} is Close")

output:

% python3 check_server.py
Enter hostname : google.com
Enter port : 8000
Port 8000 on google.com is Close
% python3 check_server.py
Enter hostname : localhost
Enter port : 22
Port 22 on localhost is Open


Task #3: The Curl Detective Mystery
🧩 Scenario
Detectives often record every clue exactly as found. Similarly, you will build a Python server
( server.py ) that accepts HTTP requests sent via curl and prints the raw request exactly
as received


% curl http://localhost:9090/test
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

% python3 curl_server.py
Curl server is listening...
'GET /test HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9090
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
Accept: */*



% curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/test -d "Detective at work"
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

% python3 curl_server.py
Curl server is listening...
'POST /test HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9090
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
Accept: */*
Content-Length: 17

%  curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/bigdata -d "$(python3 -c "print('X'*500)")"
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

% python3 curl_server.py

'POST /bigdata HTTP/1.1

3. Problem Statement
You are provided with a bastion host that has a public IP address and a .pem key for SSH, along with a private application server that can only be accessed through the bastion. A MySQL RDS instance is also running inside the private subnet. You are expected to first connect to the bastion using the provided .pem file and then attempt to securely SSH into the private application server from there. Once inside the private instance, verify connectivity to the given RDS endpoint the MySQL client. 
Note: As part of the task, you are expected to troubleshoot and resolve any issues you encounter while establishing SSH connectivity to the private instance or while reaching the MySQL RDS instance from it.

4. Problem Statement
Develop two simple applications running on different ports, for example one on port 5001 and another on port 5002, each returning a distinct response. Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) on port 8080 with path-based routing so that requests to /api are directed to the first application and requests to /app are directed to the second. Since the ALB may become a bottleneck, add a Network Load Balancer (NLB) using HAProxy in front of it, operating at Layer 4. The expected flow is:
 
Flow: Client → NLB (L4) → ALB (L7) → Web servers
 
Configure the NLB in TCP mode and test the behavior by sending requests through it. Use tools such as curl -v and tcpdump to observe and capture the traffic flow. Compare the behavior with direct access to the ALB. 
Analyze why inconsistencies appear when the NLB is in TCP mode and HTTP mode
 Finally, update the configuration to HTTP Mode and explain your findings


$ cat server5001.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello! The app is running on port 5001"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5001)

$ cat server5002.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello from APP (port 5002)"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5002)

in ALB

Create it with two listerners that has a target group pointing to 5001 and 5002 to the same instance

% curl http://tharun-alb-1723557133.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/api
Hello! The app is running on port 5001

% curl http://tharun-alb-1723557133.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8080/app
Hello from APP (port 5002)




now create a HAProxy instance that acts has NLB

in the instance

$ sudo apt-get install haproxy -y



add these lines inside /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

frontend nlb_frontend
    bind *:80
    default_backend alb_backend

backend alb_backend
    option httpchk GET /
    server alb  tharun-alb-1723557133.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8080 check

$ sudo systemctl restart haproxy

now when i do 

$ curl http://44.222.153.15/api
Hello! The app is running on port 5001

$ curl http://44.222.153.15/app
Hello from APP (port 5002)
x
